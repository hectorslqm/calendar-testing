# Calendar Testing Project

## Overview

This project is a simple calendar application designed to retrieve events from an ICS (iCalendar) URL and display them in a list format. The primary goal of this project is to explore and understand the elements that can be extracted from ICS files. It serves as a learning tool to demonstrate how to work with calendar data and parse it effectively.
